A project I'm working on with bioinformatics professor at RIT, Gregory Babbitt

## Instructions: ##

1. Download or `git clone` entire directory
2. In a terminal, `cd` to the root of the repo
3. Run `scripts/build.sh` from the root of the repo
    * This script makes sure you have all the requirements installed, and then unzips YeastGenome.zip into `data/YeastGenome`
4. If you want to do a test run, open `code/main.pl` and change line 10 to read `my @yeastGenome = glob "../data/YeastGenome-tmp/*";`.  
5. Run `code/main.pl` from the root of the repo
6. Get a glass of wine or coffee, depending on the time of day.If you're running the full program, you may want to leave for a weekend trip. When you come back, the program *might* be finished.
7. It's done! Browse the `/figures` directory for cool stuff,
